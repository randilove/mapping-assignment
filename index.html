        <p><span>W</span>ealth is the ultimate gatekeeper of history. Many communities have historical societies which aim to archive the past of their residents. But when grants and funding play a role in outreach, those same institutions find it hard to collect experiences from Black, Indigenous and other people of color.</p>

       <p>The Center for Brooklyn History Press Officer Fritzi Bodenheimer said public programs are a way to highlight the worth and importance of collections, to which Director Heather Malin agrees.</p>
 
        <p>“There's kind of an infinite amount of work that can be done to repair holes in our history where we are talking about BIPOC communities,” Malin said. “They've been traditionally undervalued, under-preserved and under-protected in the history of this country, and specifically in institutions that are in historical preservation.”</p>
 
        <p>In the ‘70s and ‘80s, the center shifted its focus to include overlooked histories and experiences.</p>
 
        <p>“A series of really smart, progressive directors ran this place and really started thinking about how to be a reparative archive, and also how to capture history as it's being made,” Malin said.</p>

        <p>Malin said that goal continues to bring materials into the archives and collections that reflect the reality of the borough “but certainly, also, with more of a focus on community engagement.”</p>
 
        <p>During the summer of 2020, the center gathered materials surrounding the protests and activism sparked by the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.</p>
 
        <p>Brooklyn Resists, an outdoor exhibition that ran from Juneteenth 2021 through September on the corners of Pierrepont and Clinton streets, aimed to display and expand existing documentation related to the experience of Black Brooklynites facing systemic racial injustice.</p>
 
        <p>The online version of the exhibit included the materials—by acquiring new photography, oral histories and ephemera—from the Black Lives Matter protests.</p>
 
        <p>“We think it's really important to be able to have those materials to share with regular, everyday users and researchers in perpetuity as part of our collection,” Malin said.</p>

        <p>She said organizations and people think about preserving materials when an institution or a person is in a time of transition “because that's when you tend to think about all the stuff you have, right?”</p>
 
        <p>Bronx County Historical Society Librarian and Archivist Dr. Steven Payne said his organization has funding issues, but has been awarded grants and received donations that allow project development.</p>
 
        <p>The Bronx African American History Project and the Bronx Latino History Project started before his employment with the society, but the archivist and the part-time librarian had already retired. The society's involvement in the collections was on the back burner until his hiring.</p>
 
        <p>Payne said he jumped at the chance to reinvigorate participation by adding oral histories to the existing photographs, artifacts and other materials. The Bronx African American History Project has a partnership with Fordham University. Many community members are involved, giving it more stability than the newer Bronx Latino History Project.</p>
 
        <p>Funding and the lack of attention made it harder to collect oral histories. Payne said he started gathering them in May 2021 and has about 37 so far. He collected most of them via Zoom, which wasn’t too costly. The in-person method has been difficult because of the price of recording materials for video and audio.</p>
 
        <p>With the African American project, Payne said most Black people settled in the Bronx in the ‘30s after fleeing the South to escape the tremendous violence of Jim Crow.</p>
 
        <p>He said slavery regimes tried to “stamp out any kind of history, especially in written sources—and in some places, it was near total—but the stories, of course, lived on in the oral tradition and people's families.”</p>

        <p>Lynda Day, a professor in the Africana Studies Department at Brooklyn College agreed with Malin, saying most archives contain materials of the wealthy people of any society and their interpretation of history.</p>
 
        <p>“Poor people's things tend to get thrown away. Somebody dies and whoever comes in is like ‘Oh, who wants this junk?’ and they throw it away,” Day said. “This is a problem with people who are marginalized financially and in society.”</p>
 
        <p>New Jersey Historical Society Library Research Specialist James Amemasor said because of the financial crisis in 2008, the ramifications of funding has been a problem, but the New Jersey Historical Commission has been supportive of many of his organization's projects.</p>
 
        <p>History, Memory, Acknowledgement: The African Diaspora in New Jersey, is a collection Amemasor is developing. He wants to increase public awareness and quality access to societies relating to people of African descent.</p>
 
        <p>“Beginning in the 1960s, there was a conscious effort to reach out to Black folks and collect things that they have rather than what white folks had to say about them,” Amemasor said.</p>
 
        <p>The Center for Brooklyn History Press Officer Fritzi Bodenheimer said public programs are another way to highlight the worth of collections, to which Malin agreed.</p>
 
        <p>“There's kind of an infinite amount of work that can be done to repair holes in our history where we are talking about BIPOC communities,” Malin said. “They've been traditionally undervalued, under-preserved and under-protected in the history of this country, and specifically in institutions that are in historical preservation.”</p>
